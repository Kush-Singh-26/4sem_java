# LAB 7
1.	Aim of the program -Write a program to perform following operations on user entered strings and a character â€“
    1)	Change the case of the string
    2)	Reverse the string
    3)	Compare two strings
    4)	Insert one string into another string
    5)	Convert the string to upper case and lower case
    6)	Check whether the character is present in the string and at which position
    7)	Check whether the string is palindrome or not.
    8)	Check the number of word, vowel and consonant in the string


    - Input:  Enter a String    :  amit
    - Output:	The string after changing the case is AMIT
            The string after reversing is  tima

	- Input: Enter the second string for comparision : kumar
    - Output: The difference between ASCII value is 10

	- Input: Enter the string to be inserted into first string : thakur
	- Output: The string after insertion is : amit thakur
    
    - Input:    Enter a String : Amit
	- Output: 
        - Uppercase: AMIT
        - Lowercase: amit

	- Input: 
        - Enter a String :Amitkumar
        - Enter a character : m 
    - Output:  Position of entered character: 2

	- Input: Enter a String : Amitkumar
         		Enter a character : Y 
		Output: Entered character is not present   


    - Input: Enter a String :  madam 
    - Output: Entered string is palindrome

	- Input: Enter a String : muscle
    - Output: Entered string is not a palindrome

    - Input: Enter a String :  Ram is going to school
	- Output: 
        - No. of words: 5
      	- No. of vowels: 7
     	- No. of consonants: 11 

2.	Aim of the program - Write a java program which will accept students details like Student RollNo, Name, Subject, Marks from the keyboard using scanner class, stored the same in a file. Again open the file, read the content and display all. 
- Input: 
    - Enter student details -   Rollno, name, subject, marks
    - Enter the name of existing file to which student details will be written.
- Output: Display the content of existing file

3.	Aim of the program - Write a program in Java to copy the content of a given file to another user entered file using character stream (using File Reader and FileWriter Classes)  and byte Stream (using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream Class).
    - Input: 
        - Enter the source file name -  sourcefile.txt  (Assume Input file exists in the system)
 		- Enter the destination file name -   destinationfile.txt
    - Output: File Copied
4.	Aim of the program -Write a java program to compare two binary files, printing the first byte position where they differ.
- Input: Specify two binary files in the program (Assume two files  are exist in the 			system)
- Output: Two files are equal

- Input: Specify two binary files in the program
- Output: Two files are not equal: byte position at which two files differ is 30
5.	Aim of the program -Write a java program that displays the number of characters, no. of lines and no. of words present in a text file whose name is given by the user.
    - Input: Name of the file - filename
	- Output: 
        - No. of characters - A,
		- No .of  lines  - B
		- No . of words - C
